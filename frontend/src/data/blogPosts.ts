      <p>Pricing is both an art and a science. Understanding the psychology behind pricing can help you set rates that maximize revenue and keep your clients satisfied.</p>
      <h2 class='text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4'>Anchoring and Perceived Value</h2>
      <p>Clients often compare your prices to a reference point. Use anchoring by presenting a higher-priced option first, making your standard offering seem more affordable.</p>

      <h2 class='text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4'>Bundle Offers</h2>
      <p>Bundling services or products can increase perceived value and encourage clients to choose higher-value packages.</p>
      <h2 class='text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4'>Transparency</h2>
      <p>Be transparent about your pricing structure. Clear, upfront pricing builds trust and reduces friction in the sales process.</p>
